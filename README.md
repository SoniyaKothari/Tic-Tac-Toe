#Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed in JAVA.
How to Play:-
1. Run the program from the console.
2. Players take turns entering a number (0-8) to place their mark.
3. The game board updates after each move, showing the current state of the game.
4. The game continues until a player wins by aligning three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or the board is filled, resulting in a draw.
